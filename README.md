# new-years-escape-room

This repository houses all of the software components of the new years escape room we're making. The full design doc can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/12BrIimsZGX9xuCqszjtZbTBARApfrHD-KXACEy3qZbk/edit).

This repo is broken down into four sub projects. One for the electron app that will run on the computer, one for the chess puzzle, one for the plant puzzle, and one for the bookshelf puzzle. They can all be opened together with the VSCode workspace at the root of this repo.
